# Enhanced Classification of Boosted Bottom Quarks Using Deep Learning Technique

Abstract: 

In this study, we address the limitations of existing models in differentiating between bottom quark-initiated jets (b-jets) and jets from lighter quarks or gluons, focusing on challenges such as inaccuracies, computational inefficiencies, and a lack of generalizability across different data sets. By employing a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and random forests within a comprehensive deep learning framework, we refine these models to enhance performance significantly. This multi-faceted approach leverages the raw data from particle detectors, capturing the nuanced dynamics of high-energy collision events as the primary input for our sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Drawing upon simulated datasets that accurately mirror real collision scenarios, we have developed classifiers tailored specifically for identifying b-jets. A pivotal advancement in our methodology is the incremental integration of detailed data from the CMS tracking detector, including reconstructed hits from the pixel detector and their impact parameters. By concentrating exclusively on calorimeter energy deposits and reconstructed hits from the pixel detector, our enriched classifier achieves a remarkable accuracy score of 95.01% in b-jet tagging, demonstrating a significant leap over existing methodologies in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.
